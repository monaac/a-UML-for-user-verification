# a-UML-for-user-verification
a UML class diagram for user verification using sql

This UML diagram represents two classes: User and UserVerification. The User class represents a user with the following attributes:

username: the user's username
password: the user's password
email: the user's email
role: the user's role
The User class also has a verify() method, although this method is not implemented.

The UserVerification class is responsible for verifying the user. It has a verify(User) method that takes a User object as an argument and performs the verification process.
